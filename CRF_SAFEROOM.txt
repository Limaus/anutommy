Respected sir,

1. Automated penalty systems need to be developed for No safe room arm alert. Alert details should collect from intellve supervisor report. Alert report should be taken after 9 pm on the same day. Penalty will be calculated based on below table

Safe/Strong room Up to three alerts in a day, a penalty will not be imposed. From fourth alert onward penalty should be Imposed Rs.10/- per alert. Example   In a day if any branch getting 10 alerts, Penalty will be imposed only 7 alerts (10-3=7),

So 7 X Rs.10= Rs.70

sl   Particular			penalty

Branch Head             Rs.10( 4th  alert onwards)

2 Area Head     	Average of respective all BH penalty
